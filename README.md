# Project Overview

This project focuses on using a Bayesian approach to predict air quality based on data from the previous several days. 
# Method

## Dataset
- The dataset is from Taiwan Ministry of Environment.

## Preprocessing
- Drop the data with NULL value.
- Drop some features such as publish time.
- Tokenize the Sitename since the feature is Chinese word.

## Model
- Use Pymc build a Bayesian statistical model do the prediction.

## Visualization
- Build scatter plot for each feature to obseve the relation between feature and target.

# Usage Instructions

1. Execute preprocess.py for the CSV that is used as dataset.
2. Execute Baye.ipynb to do the prediction.
3. Can use data_visualize.py to analyse features.

# Important Notes

The results generated by this system are exploratory and intended to assist analysis. They are not definitive conclusions and should not be used as the sole basis for decision-making. Further expert discussion is required for final interpretations.
